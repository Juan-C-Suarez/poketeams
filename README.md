# Poketeams by Juan Carlos Su√°rez Jaimes
Poketeams is a web application that allows users to build teams for Pokemon games and also 
view the teams created by other users. This web application uses the API **PokeAPI** for getting
data about Pokemon, items, moves, etc.

## Features
1. **Teambuilder:** Logged in users can create a Pokemon team. Each team has six Pokemon
chosen by the user. The user chooses the ability, nature, held item and moves of each
of the team's Pokemon. All these choices are displayed using select elements that are populated
with the options fetched from PokeAPI. Additionally, the user is supposed to name the team
and describe their strategy in a textarea.

2. **Team Lists:** The index page, profile page and Pokemon page display lists of teams
created by users. The selection of teams displayed varies depending on the page, but all
share the following features:

    1. A select element is used to choose the ordering method. The options are most popular teams
first (teams with the most points), newest teams first and oldest teams first.

    2. Infinite Scroll: Only five teams are loaded at first, but as the user scrolls down, the next
five teams are loaded.

    3. If logged in, the user can click a button to like or unlike (if already liked) a team.
Liking a team increases its number of points.

3. **Profile Page:** Clicking on a username takes the user to the corresponding profile page.
The profile displays an image of the user's avatar, the user's total points (sum of the points
form all their posts) and a list of all the teams submitted by the user, as described in the
Team List feature.

4. **Stats:** The stats page displays a list of the top 10 most used Pokemon, along with the number
of teams that Pokemon was incluided in. The page also displays a selector the user can use
in order to go to that Pokemon's page.

5. **Pokemon Page:** Clicking on a Pokemon's name or searching it using the stats page takes the
user to that Pokemon's page, which displays a list of all the teams that include that Pokemon,
as described in the Team List Feature.

6. **Team Page:** Clicking on a team's name takes the user to that team's page, which displays
detailed information about the team and each of its Pokemon. It's also possible to like or unlike
the team using this page's like button.

7. **Accounts:** Users can login, register and logout from the website.
